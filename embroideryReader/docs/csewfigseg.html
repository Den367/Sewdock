Most numerical values appear to be 16 bit signed ints and are shown as such in this document, unless otherwise noted.
All characters appear to be ascii.

This class appears to be very similar to CEmbOne, with additional info
for color changes.

CSewFigSeg 
Start stitch blocks 
Block:
    (block type) 
    (color index)
    (number of stitches in this block)
    (x value)
    (y value)
    (x value)
    (y value)
    (x value)
    ...
    When all the stitches in this block have been read, there will be a
    block seperator/joiner with one of these values:
    -32765 (03 80 in hex, 32771 as UInt16) Meaning another block is next.
    OR
    A smaller positive number, seems to be between 0 and 100 and seems to
    indicate a color change. If this is the case, there will be 13 more
    values (26 bytes), the last of which tells if there is another block or
    not. (-32767 (01 80 in hex) for yes, -1 (00 FF in hex) for no) 
    If there is another block coming, there will be another 24 values
    (48 bytes), and then the next block will start. If not, there will be
    1 more value (2 bytes) which seems to always be 0. This seems to be
    a common ending to all the classes. (-1, 0)
(block)
(block seperator)
(block)
(block seperator)
...
when you get a block seperator that has the -1 value mentoined above, stitch blocks are done
